# INDE 577 -- Data Science and Machine Learning
This repository covers a graduate-level industrial engineering course on the fundamentals of data science and machine learning. 

Machine learning is the science of programming computers so they can *learn from data*, i.e. "learn" without being programmed. It is useful for simplifying problems where existing solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long lists of rules, finding solutions to complex problems, fluctuating environments that require adaptation to new data, and managing large amounts of data.

What can machine learning be used for?
- personalizing experiences: better recommendations, search results, notifications, and ads
- identify anomalies: detecting fraud, spam, hate speech, and tumors
- create means of interaction: chatbot natural language processing, image recognition, and speech recognition so apps can react to voice commands
- provide insights: understanding different ways analytics can be grouped and evaluating features, summarizing documens
- prepare content: making predictions about future behavior to preload content and reduce wait times, representing high-dimensional data in a clear diagram, or forecasting revenue

## Course Description
Fundamentals of data science and machine learning during the Fall 2021 semester at Rice University. Topics include: introduction to scikit-learn, Keras and tensorflow2, linear and logistic regression, clustering, support vector machines, random forest trees, neural networks, deep learning, natural language processing. Recommended Prerequisite(s): Three semesters of calculus. A background in some programming language would be extremely useful.

Files in this repository are Jupyter Notebook projects demonstrating machine learning algorithms learned in class and referenced in various textbooks. This repository primarily contains supervised learning algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms.

Data Science tools used in this course:
- Python version 3.6 or higher
  - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html)
