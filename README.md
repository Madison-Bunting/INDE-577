## Course Description
Fundamentals of data science and machine learning during the Fall 2021 semester at Rice University. Topics include: introduction to scikit-learn, Keras and tensorflow2, linear and logistic regression, clustering, support vector machines, random forest trees, neural networks, deep learning, natural language processing. Recommended Prerequisite(s): Three semesters of calculus. A background in some programming language would be extremely useful.

Files in this repository are Jupyter Notebook projects demonstrating machine learning algorithms learned in class and referenced in various textbooks. This repository primarily contains supervised learning algorithms and supervised learning algorithms.

Data Science tools used in this course:
- Python version 3.6 or higher
