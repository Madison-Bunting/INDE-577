In Supervised learning, we feed the algorithm a dataset that also includes the solutions, called **labeled data**, and the algorithm is designed to "learn by example". For example, hashtags on social media, or features of a house (number of bedrooms/bathrooms, location, price). It can be compared to learning that takes place in the presence of a supervisor or teacher.

A supervised learning algorithm learns from the labeled training data and helps the user predict outcomes for unforeseen data. Algorithms attempt to fit a line to that labeled data to either split it into categories (classification) or represent a trend (regression), and this line allows us to make predictions. Successfully building, scaling, and deploying accurate supervised machine learning data science models takes time and technical expertise from a team of highly skilled data scientists. Moreover, data scientists must rebuild models to make sure the insights remain true until the data changes. 

Supervised learning works with: 
- labeled data
- direct feedback
- predict outcome/future

Types of supervised learning algorithms:
- **classification**
  - goal: assign each input value and assign it to a class or category that it fits based on the training data
  - predicted output is a list of tags or values
  - e.g. spam filters, with tages "spam" or "not spam"
  - popular classificaiton algorithms: linear classifiers, K nearest neighbor, support vector machines, decision trees, random forest
- **regression**
  - goal: find a relationship between dependent and independent variables
  - predicted output is a target numeric value, given a set of features, and is represented by a line of best fit (for a model with more than two features, this is often a hyperplane)
  - e.g. price of a car, given: mileage, age, brand, make, model, etc
  - popular regression algorithms: linear regression, logistic regression, polynomial regression
