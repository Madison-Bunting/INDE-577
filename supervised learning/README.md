In Supervised learning, we feed the algorithm a dataset that also includes the solutions, called **labeled data**, and the algorithm is designed to "learn by example". For example, hashtags on social media, or features of a house (number of bedrooms/bathrooms, location, price). It can be compared to learning that takes place in the presence of a supervisor or teacher.

A supervised learning algorithm learns from the labeled training data and helps the user predict outcomes for unforeseen data. Algorithms attempt to fit a line to that labeled data to either split it into categories (classification) or represent a trend (regression), and this line allows us to make predictions. Successfully building, scaling, and deploying accurate supervised machine learning data science models takes time and technical expertise from a team of highly skilled data scientists. Moreover, data scientists must rebuild models to make sure the insights remain true until the data changes. 

Supervised learning works with: 
- labeled data
- direct feedback
- predict outcome/future

Types of supervised learning algorithms:
- classification
  - predicted output is a list of tags or values
  - e.g. spam filters
- regression
  - predicted output is target numeric value, given a set of features
  - e.g. price of a car, given: mileage, age, brand, make, model, etc
