The [Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) is a supervised, single layer neural network binary classifier. It was developed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958. Single-layer perceptrons can be combined together into a [Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)](https://github.com/Madison-Bunting/INDE-577/tree/main/supervised%20learning/4%20-%20neural%20networks)

Perceptrons are trained in three phases:

**1. Data Processing**

  As a binary classifier, perceptrons are meant to classify input into two groups: yes/no, black/white, up/down, etc, corresponding to 1/0 or 1/-1 outputs (depending on the selected activation function). To prepare data, we must first determine the two output groups and classify data in numerical terms, at which point the data will be in a format that will allow the perceptron to be trained. 
  
**2. Predict Results**

- Choose an activation function
