Unsupervised learning involves finding structures and relationships from inputs, and is helpful when we have unlabeled data or aren't sure which outputs are meaningful. There is a set of data that is **unlabeled** to learn from, with the goal of identifying patterns in that data. The result of an unsupervised learning model is to place observations into 1) specific clusters, or 2) to create rules to identify associations between variables

Variables:
- features

Types of Algorithms:
- Clustering
  - Finding similarities/patterns in observed data
  - e.g. detecting groups of similar visitors to a blog (40% male comic book lovers who read in the evening vs 20% young sci-fi lovers who visit on weekends)
- Association
  - Identify sequences and new and interesting insights between different objects in a set. In this case, the pattern identified is a rule (like if *this* then *that*)
  - e.g. analyzing supermarket data and finding that people who buy bbq sauce and potato chips tend to also buy steak
