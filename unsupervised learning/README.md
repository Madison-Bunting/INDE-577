Description:

Involves finding structures and relationships from inputs. There is a set of data that is **unlabeled** to learn from. The result of an unsupervised learning model is to place observations into
1) specific clusters, or
2) to create rules to identify associations between variables

Variables:
- features

Types of Algorithms:
- Clustering
  - Finding similarities/patterns in observed data
  - e.g. K-means, SVD, PCA, Hierarchical clustering
- Association
  - Identify sequences, identify new and interesting insights between different objects in a set
  - e.g. Frequent Patter-Growth, Apriori Algorithm
